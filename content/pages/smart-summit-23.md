      Join the fun and sharpen your development skills with us at the Flow
      Integration Workshop in Rio! This is an amazing event for national dev's,
      with a whole week of learning and networking with Flow representatives and
      ambassadors. On day 1, you'll get to dive into the technology and learn
      everything about Flow implementation.


      Then it's time to get your hands dirty and create an amazing project for
      the DEMO DAY on the 20th, where you can win spectacular prizes like
      300USDC in the main award.


      **And what if you only want to participate in the DEMO DAY?**


      No problem, the content from day 1 will be made available online!

      But wait, there's more: if you stand out at the Workshop, you can
      participate in the Global Flow Hackathon, with total prizes of over US$
      100,000, from February 10th to 26th! Who knows, your project could be the
      next one to win the award for best mobile experience or the "Extend the
      Ecosystem" award?


      Don't miss this opportunity and come join us for an amazing journey in the
      tech world with Flow!
